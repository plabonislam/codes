1.Rules for C:: 
  “C” is normally pronounced as a “K.” 
It sounds like an “S” if it is followed by “E” “I” or “Y.” Example: “circus.” The first “C” is followed by an “I” so it sounds like an “S.”
	
The second “C” is followed by a “U” so it sounds like a “K.” The same principle applies to “cycle.”
The word “accent” follows the same rule. The first “C” is followed by another “C” so it sounds
like a “K.” The second “C” is followed by an “E” so it sounds like an “S.”


2.1.Rules for g:: 
  A “G” sounds like a “J” if it is followed by “E” “I” or “Y.” Examples are giraffe, giant, gypsy,general, raging.
otherwise it sounds like “G” in “goose.” or silent.There are some exceptions to this rule,The most common exceptions come from Germanicroots which don’t have this rule, like give, get, girl, forgive, forget.
